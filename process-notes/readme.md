# readme

For my 3D Scan, I used the Android Application SCANN3D. I was hoping it would work to capture the model correctly but it did not capture it exactly how I envisioned it. I can absolutely bring a physical copy for you to see  of the artifact if the 3D model is not doing justice. 


Update: will attempt to scan again using the model, this time I have a found a solution that allows me to fully walk around the object in order to get a more accurate scan.


Update: tried another scan of the model, however due to lighting it is not seeming to work out, also Regard 3D seems to make my computer (MacBook pro) crash, either due to file being too large or computer just not being able to handle it.

Update: for an alternative I will post a article link where the picture of Orange Calcite can be viewed. Although not the same colour blend and cut that I personally own, it will still serve the purpose of giving the reader a visual of what it is supposed to look like on average.
