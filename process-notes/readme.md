For my 3D Scan, I used the Android Application SCANN3D. I was hoping it would work to capture the model correctly but it did not capture it exactly how I envisioned it. I can absolutely bring a physical copy for you to see  of the artifact if the 3D model is not doing justice. 
Update: will attempt to scan again using the model, this time I have a found a solution that allows me to fully walk around the object in order to get a more accurate scan.
