For my 3D Model project, I have decided to conduct a model for Orange Calcite which is an extremely abundant mineral that can be found in deposits all over the world mostly notably in Africa and some Asian countries. Orange Calcite is comprised of mainly calcium carbonate which gives it the distinctive "orange" colour. Other colours of this mineral do exist such as white, green, and yellow.

There are many uses for Orange Calcite. One of the most notable uses for this mineral is the ability for it to be cut and sized-down in order to make incredible and elaborate pieces of jewellery such as necklaces and earrings. According to a newspaper article written by the San Diego Union Tribune, documentation has shown that calcite has been used in the era of World War 2 and has been used specifically in machinery and various forms of weaponry. However, more notably, Orange Calcite is used as a spiritual element known to provide an abundance of happiness, the ability to form new and interesting ideas, as well as enhance creativity and reduce depression and anxiety when placed in your home.

Minerals and Gemstones have always been a part of our society for as long as history can take us. Tribal communities have found that gemstones have properties of spiritual being and general wellness associated with them and would often form rituals over them or craft them into various items in order to inhibit it’s healing and spiritual effects. Other societies have used them in the form of weaponry and structural formation as the material is very robust and indeed, very strong. In the context of our lessons in Digital History, we can relate Orange Calcite cultural meaning and how different societies and cultures can view this mineral in different ways (i.e tribal communities viewing calcite for its supposedly healing and spiritual properties, etc..) We as a society make perceptions based off of what we see and what we perceive the main uses for an object to be. 

Scanning this object in order to create a 3D Model was proven a challenge time and time again. Being that this is a mineral with many different types of unusual shading and cutting on its surface, making an exact model was extremely difficult and more often than not, did not turn out as planned or did not turn out as anything at all.  A lesson learned in this scenario is to find a more solid object that is more robust and that is able to be scanned fully such as a statue, small artifact, small building, etc… 

I am excited to build upon this model and transition it back into the physical world through the sturcture of this course. I believe that my model is very open to ideas and interpretation as this mineral is used in a variety of different aspects and has a wide range of uses.
