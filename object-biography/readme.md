For my 3D Model project, I have decided to conduct a model for Orange Calcite which is an extremely abudant mineral that can be found in deposits all over the world mostly notably in Africa and some Asian countries. Orange Calcite is comprised of mainly calcium carbonate which gives it the distinctive "orange" colour. Other colours of this mineral do exist such as white,green, and yellow. 

There are many uses for Orange Calcite. One of the most notable uses for this mineral is the ability for it to be cut and sized-down in order to make incredible and elaborate pieces of jewelery such as neckalaces and earrings. According to a newspaper article written by the San Diego Union Tribune, documentation has shown that calcite has been used in the era of World War 2 and has been used specifically in machinery and various forms of weaponry. However, more notably, Orange Calcite is used as a spiritual element known to provide an abundance of happiness, the ability to form new and interesting ideas, as well as enhance creativity and reduce depression and anxiety when placed in your home.

This artificat was a personal gift to me brought by a family friend from a mining cave in the depths of Africa. In Africa, it is very common to find minerals such as Calcite, Diamonds, Lapis, and other types of minerals and/or ores. Calcite seas existed in Earth's history when the primary inorganic precipitate of calcium carbonate in marine waters was low-magnesium calcite (lmc), as opposed to the aragonite and high-magnesium calcite (hmc) precipitated today. This was a product of the large meteor that struke the face of the earth over a million years ago. Since this meteor has a large repository of calcite, the mineral spread to the Earth's oceanic crust and thus, produced calicte seas. Over time, the calicte seas began to decrease and appeared in caves where small water repositories have bveen held, thus the reasoning why there can be so many found in limestones caves.
