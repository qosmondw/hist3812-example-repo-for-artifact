For my 3D Model project, I have decided to conduct a model for Orange Calcite which is an extremely abudant mineral that can be found in deposits all over the world mostly notably in Africa and some Asian countries. Orange Calcite is comprised of mainly calcium carbonate which gives it the distinctive "orange" colour. Other colours of this mineral do exist such as white,green, and yellow. 

There are many uses for Orange Calcite. One of the most notable uses for this mineral is the ability for it to be cut and sized-down in order to make incredible and elaborate pieces of jewelery such as neckalaces and earrings. According to a newspaper article written by the San Diego Union Tribune, documentation has shown that calcite has been used in the era of World War 2 and has been used specifically in machinery and various forms of weaponry. However, more notably, Orange Calcite is used as a spiritual element known to provide an abundance of happiness, the ability to form new and interesting ideas, as well as enhance creativity and reduce depression and anxiety when placed in your home.
